# EVA: Evaluating Vegetation and Atmosphere

## EVA is a raspberry pi based grow room monitoring system. Using a raspberry pi camera and a host of sensors, EVA can be used to monitor your grow setup.

### Build Guide

The build itself is super simple. Steps are:
1. Download NOOBS
2. Install Raspbian Lite (headless!)
3. Install and run RPI-CAM-Web-Interface (found here: <https://elinux.org/RPi-Cam-Web-Interface>)

So far, that's it. This repo will have the mods you need to install, but I haven't gotten
there quite yet.
